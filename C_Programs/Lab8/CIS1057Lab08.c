Problem 1: 10 points

A resistor is a circuit device designed to have a specific resistance value
between its ends. Resistance values are expressed in ohms or kilo-ohms.
Resistors are frequently marked with colored bands that encode their
resistance values, as shown below. The first two bands are digits, and the
third is a power-of-ten multiplier.

The table below shows the meanings of each band color. For example, if the
first band is green, the second is black, and the third is yellow, the resistor has a
value of 50 x 10^4 or 500k.  The 50 is 10 x green(index 5) + black(index 0)).  The
10^4 is 10^yellow(index 4).  The information in the table can be stored in a C program
as an array of strings.

    char COLOR_CODES[10][7] = {"black", "brown", "red",
    "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "gray",
    "white"};

Notice that "red" is COLOR_CODES[2] and has a digit value of 2 and a multiplier
value of 10 2 . In general, COLOR_CODES[ n ] has digit value n and multiplier value 10 n .
Write a function that accepts the colors of Band 1, Band 2, and Band 3,
and then returns the resistance in kilo-ohms. Include a helper function search
that takes three parameters--the list of strings, the size of the list, and a target
string, and returns the subscript of the list element that matches the target or
returns -1 if the target is not in the list.

Color Codes for Resistors*
    Color Value     Digit Value     Multiplier
    Black           0               10^0
    Brown           1               10^1
    Red             2               10^2
    Orange          3               10^3
    Yellow          4               10^4
    Green           5               10^5
    Blue            6               10^6
    Violet          7               10^7
    Gray            8               10^8
    White           9               10^9

    FORMULA:
    resistance = (digit0 * 10 + digit1) * (10^multiplier);

Problem 2: 5 points

Write a function that takes nouns and forms their plurals on the basis of
these rules:

    a. If noun ends in "y", remove the "y" and add "ies".
    b. If noun ends in "s", "ch", or "sh", add "es".
    c. In all other cases, just add "s".

Print each noun and its plural. Try the following data:

Write and test a function that finds and returns through an output parameter

"procrastination" and "destination" is "stination", of "globally" and "internally"
is "ally", and of "gloves" and "dove" is the empty string).
